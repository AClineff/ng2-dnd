# Ng2Dnd

This lightweight tool is for easy tracking of D&D combat.  

Ideally the server will serve 2 modes - A DM View with all AC, HitPoints, etc. and a Player View which will only display the order of the combatants.  

## Development server

Run `yarn serve` to deploy both the angular app and express server

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the front end unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

I need to learn express testing.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
